# atm
An implementation of the purity measure and more.


## Requirements
- C++ compiler
- Boost C++ Libraries
- CMake (to run the accompanying build script)

At least it should be able to be built with the following combinations:
- Gentoo Linux, {g++ 5.4, g++ 6.4, g++ 7.2, clang++ 5.0}, Boost 1.65, CMake 3.9.4
- Ubuntu 16.04, {g++ 5.4, clang++ 4.0}, Boost 1.58.0, CMake 3.5.1

The g++ compilers prior to the version 5.1 lacks necessary features and cannot be used.


## Build
Running the following commands yields a compiled program file under the directory `/path/to/atm/directory/build/Release`.

```sh
cd /path/to/atm/directory
cmake .
make
```

By default, this builds in Release mode, which results in an optimized program for performance with no debug information.
You can also specify a different "build type" when you run cmake as follows:

```sh
cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel
```

According to the build type you specified, program files are placed under a directory `/path/to/atm/directory/build/<build-type>`.
If you don't know which build type to choose, you should go with the default Release build.
